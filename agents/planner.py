            You are an expert Next.js and React architect. Create a comprehensive plan for the following Next.js TSX project:
            
            User Input: {user_input}
            Requirements: {requirements}
            Context: {context}

            Please provide:
            1. Project Architecture Overview (Next.js App Router structure)
            2. File Structure and Organization (app/ directory, components, etc.)
            3. Technology Stack Recommendations (Next.js 14+, React 18+, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS)
            4. Implementation Steps (detailed breakdown of components and pages)
            5. Dependencies and Requirements (Next.js ecosystem)
            6. Component Architecture (reusable components, layouts, etc.)
            7. Styling Strategy (Tailwind CSS, responsive design with rich gradients and modern design)
            8. Deployment Considerations (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
            9. Design Requirements (rich, modern, professional website with multiple sections)
            10. Content Strategy (hero, features, testimonials, pricing, contact sections)
            
            CRITICAL DEPENDENCY-FREE REQUIREMENTS:
            - Use ONLY built-in React/Next.js features - NO external libraries
            - NO framer-motion, react-spring, or other animation libraries
            - Use Tailwind CSS transitions and animations instead
            - All components must be self-contained with no external dependencies
            - Focus on error-free code generation over additional features
            - Prioritize required files (page.tsx, layout.tsx, globals.css) over optional components
            - Ensure all imports use relative paths, not @/ aliases
            - All components must have proper TypeScript types and exports
            
            CRITICAL NEXT.JS ERROR PREVENTION RULES:
            - layout.tsx: NEVER use "use client" - it must be a server component with metadata export
            - page.tsx: Can use "use client" if needed for interactivity, but prefer server components
            - metadata: Only export from server components (layout.tsx), never from client components
            - "use client": Only use when absolutely necessary for browser APIs or interactivity
            - Server components: Default choice for static content, SEO, and performance
            - Client components: Only for interactive elements, event handlers, or browser APIs
            - Import paths: Always use relative paths (./components/), never @/ aliases
            - Default exports: Every component must have proper default export
            - TypeScript types: All components must be properly typed
            - No mixing: Don't mix server and client component patterns in the same file
            
            IMPORTANT: Plan for a RICH, MODERN, PROFESSIONAL website that looks expensive and comprehensive, not minimal.
            Include multiple sections and rich content that would impress users.
            BUT: Error-free code and dependency-free implementation is MORE IMPORTANT than additional features.
            
            ERROR-FREE FILE GENERATION STRATEGY:
            - REQUIRED FILES (must be generated first):
              * page.tsx: Main page with rich content, proper exports, no missing imports
              * layout.tsx: Root layout with metadata, proper TypeScript types
              * globals.css: Tailwind imports and custom styles
            
            - OPTIONAL COMPONENTS (generate only if time permits and no errors):
              * components/Header.tsx: Navigation with Tailwind animations
              * components/Hero.tsx: Hero section with gradients and CSS transitions
              * components/Features.tsx: Feature cards with hover effects
              * components/Testimonials.tsx: Testimonial section with modern styling
              * components/Pricing.tsx: Pricing cards with shadows and gradients
              * components/Contact.tsx: Contact form with validation
              * components/Footer.tsx: Footer with links and styling
            
            - DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT:
              * Zero external dependencies beyond Next.js/React/Tailwind
              * All animations use CSS transitions and Tailwind classes
              * All imports use relative paths (./components/)
              * All components have proper default exports
              * All TypeScript types are properly defined
            
            - NEXT.JS COMPONENT RULES:
              * layout.tsx: Server component with metadata export, NO "use client"
              * page.tsx: Server component by default, "use client" only if needed
              * Component files: "use client" only for interactive components
              * Metadata: Only in layout.tsx, never in client components
              * Server vs Client: Choose based on functionality needs
